##Course Overview

###Introduction
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

With Microservices, focus is shifting to getting started with developing web applications quickly. Spring Boot enables this.
Typical stuff done at the start of projects
- Framework setup
 - Identifying compatible framework versions. for example, Which version of Spring and Hibernate to use?
 - Configuring (Integrating) frameworks
  - Configuring web.xml, Configuring Dispatcher Servlet
  - Configuring data source, session factory
- Logging, Transaction Management, Error Handling  
- Configuration Management
- Configuring Servers to deploy applications to
- Monitoring Applications

###Goals
- Extracted from https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-introducing-spring-boot
- Provide quick start for projects with Spring.
- Be opinionated but provide options.
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

###Step List
- Step 01 : Todo...

###Expectations
- You should know Java. You should understand usage of Annotations.
- You should understand the basics of Spring framework.
- You are NOT expected to have any experience with Eclipse or Maven.
- We will help you install Eclipse and get up and running with Maven.

##About in28Minutes
- At in28Minutes, we ask ourselves one question everyday. How do we help you learn effectively - that is more quickly and retain more of what you have learnt?
- We use Problem-Solution based Step-By-Step Hands-on Approach With Practical, Real World Application Examples. 
- Our success on Udemy and Youtube (2 Million Views & 12K Subscribers) speaks volumes about the success of our approach.
- While our primary expertise is on Development, Design & Architecture Java & Related Frameworks (Spring, Struts, Hibernate) we are expanding into the front-end world (Bootstrap, JQuery, Angular JS). 

###Our Beliefs
- Best Courses are interactive and fun.
- Foundations for building high quality applications are best laid down while learning.

###Our Approach
- Problem Solution based Step by Step Hands-on Learning
- Practical, Real World Application Examples.
- We use 80-20 Rule. We discuss 20% things used 80% of time in depth. We touch upon other things briefly equipping you with enough knowledge to find out more on your own. 
- We will be developing a demo application in the course, which could be reused in your projects, saving hours of your effort.
- We love open source and therefore, All our code is open source too and available on Github.
